# PhosPPI-SEQ
PhosPPI-SEQ: A Deep Learning Network for Predicting the Function of Phosphorylation Sites in Regulating Protein - Protein Interactions (PPI).

PhosPPI-SEQ requires only the raw protein sequences of the concerned PPI, and concerned phosphosites as input, avoiding the problem of losing information for a large amount of phosphosites due to the limited number of protein crystal structures. It is computationally efficient and has a broader scope of application for biologists.
